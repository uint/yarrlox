# Yet Another Really Rusty Lox

This software is not meant to be useful. It's merely for practice and learning.

# But what is this?

This is an implemetation of the Lox language described in the delightful light
novel [_Crafting Interpreters_](http://craftinginterpreters.com/). The lecture
is highly recommended - it's a delectable romantic thriller, full of ups and
down, relatable characters, and touching on universal human suffering with
refreshing lightness.

Yes, the "really" wasn't _really_ needed in the name. Ye better not complain
lest ye be thrown ta th' sharks.
