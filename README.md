# Yet Another Really Rusty Lox

This is an implemetation of the Lox language described in [_Crafting Interpreters_](http://craftinginterpreters.com/). It's not meant to be useful. It's merely for practice and learning.

Yes, the "really" wasn't _really_ needed in the name. Ye better not complain or ye'll be thrown ta th' sharks.
